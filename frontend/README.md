# Frontend of JumboAppetit

## Local development

This app is built using [Expo](https://expo.dev)

To run locally (assuming mac):

1. Ensure that your local development environment has node v20.10.0 and npm.
2. Download this repository.
3. In terminal, navigate to the folder containing the source code.
3. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` or `npx expo start` to start the Expo development server. [Scan](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-project/#open-the-app-on-your-device) the outputted QR code with your phone which should have the "Expo Go" app installed. Now, whenever you make changes to the source code, the development version on your device will automatically update. 
5. If step 4 throws a module not found error related to config-plugins, may need to `npm i @expo/config-plugins`
